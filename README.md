A user-friendly blog web application for Alx Students and Mentors to create and publish engaging content. 


**INTRODUCTION**  

Alx Blog App is a web application that allows students and mentors to create and publish blog posts. 
It is designed to be easy to use and intuitive, with a clean and modern look and feel.

**Inspiration ➡️✍️**
Our inspiration came from the different platforms that we used throughout this program. We used platforms like linkedin, and Medium  to write a blog or an article, also Discord for the day to day communication with our peers and Mentors.  Based on this experience we wanted to create an Alx-Blog platform for Alx  Students and Mentors where they can share, express and discuss  new idea, articles, technologies and experiences.

**Challenges Conquered ⚔️**
1.Flask Security Concerns: Flask-WTF & Flask-Security
2.Python3 Secret: Secrets Module
3.Database(Table couldn’t be created): Flask-SQLAlchemy 3.0 all access to db.engine (db.session) requires an active Flask application context.
4.Unable to identify routes location: we used the Flask helper function url_for to find the exact location of routes.
5.Password and User Information vulnerability: we used Flask-WTF method called form.hidden_tag() to hide the fields value on the form. 

**The Takeaway: More Than Code ❤️**

Alx Blog is a journey of exploration, frustration, and ultimately, creation. It's a testament to the power of pushing your limits and learning new things.  I'm a passionate developer eager to learn, grow, and collaborate. Let's build something amazing together!
